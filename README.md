Cloned repo, configured Git, got a copy of the game running on my local machine. Woo!
One hour later...
Doh! For some reason, the sidebar's progress bars are not displaying.
I have made zero code changes so far. Time to investigate...
Using Chrome's Devtools, I see that the span containing the progress bars (quickTaskDisplay) has a class of "hidden".
Oh weird. So I went to ihtasham42's github.io version, and the quick dislay is indeed intended to be hidden. Literally never noticed this behavior before.
Not sure how I feel about this. May modify in later versions to display immediately, as it's pretty convenient. Design-wise, idle games always benefit from
visible progress bars on startup. (this may be a rare opinion. Who knows.)
